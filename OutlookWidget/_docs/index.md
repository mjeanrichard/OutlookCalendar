# Tesserae

**Self-hosted e-ink dashboard companion.** Compose tile-based dashboards in
the browser, render them headless, and deliver the resulting frame to one or
more panels over a small REST device API (MQTT retained topic is still
supported for existing setups). Every reference client, Raspberry Pi, ESP32,
Seeed reTerminal E-Series, TRMNL, jailbroken Kindle via KOReader, speaks the
same protocol.

Sibling rebuild of [inky-dash](https://github.com/dmellok/inky-dash), same job,
but every layer of the publishing pipeline is a **drop-a-folder** extension
point: new widget, new theme, new font, new renderer, new device kind. The
name comes from [*tessera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessera), the
individual tile of a mosaic; the editor composes a dashboard out of cells.

!!! tip "New here? Start with the path that matches you"
    - **I want it running** → [Install Tesserae](install/server.md) (or via [Docker](install/docker.md) / as a [Home Assistant App](install/home-assistant.md))
    - **I have a panel to drive** → [Install a client](install/clients.md) then [Set up a device](install/devices.md)
    - **I want the ready-to-go hardware path** → the [Seeed reTerminal E-Series](hardware/seeed.md) (browser flash at [tesserae.ink/flash](https://tesserae.ink/flash), battery-powered, no assembly required)
    - **What can it show?** → [Bundled widget gallery](widgets/gallery.md) (36 ship in the install) or the [community catalog](https://tesserae.ink/catalog/) (widgets, themes and templates, one-click install)
    - **What hardware works?** → [Screens & compatibility](compatibility.md)
    - **I want to build a widget** → [Build a widget with AI](dev/writing-a-widget.md)

## How it works

1. **Compose** a dashboard of cells in the editor; each cell is a widget plugin.
2. **Render** the dashboard headlessly with Chromium at the target panel's exact pixel size.
3. **Quantise** the frame to the panel's colour palette and pack it for the wire.
4. **Deliver** the packed frame over the REST device API (`GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame` for battery-poll clients, `POST /api/v1/device/<id>/frame` for always-on clients). MQTT retained topics still work for existing MQTT-based setups. A small client on the panel paints the frame and sleeps.

Every layer, the bundled widgets + the community catalog, the themes, the fonts, the renderers, the
device kinds, is a drop-a-folder plugin or a dedicated app surface
discovered at boot. See [Build a widget with AI](dev/writing-a-widget.md)
for the authoring path and [the widget contract](widgets.md) for the
full spec.

## Project status

Tesserae is a self-hosted hobby project, built in the open by a solo
maintainer with a growing group of community contributors. The
composer → renderers → transport → devices pipeline, scheduler, Home
Assistant MQTT auto-discovery, webhook push, the Spectra theme system
(browse / builder / image-to-palette extraction), font picker, and
form-driven page editor are all shipping. **Thirteen panels are
confirmed on real hardware**: the Seeed reTerminal E1001, E1002,
E1003, and E1004 and the Seeed XIAO 13.3" ePaper EE02 on the
Tesserae-native firmware (browser flash, battery-powered), the Seeed
TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY Kit over TRMNL BYOS, the Waveshare 13.3" Spectra 6
and 7.3" PhotoPainter via `esp32_bin`, the Pimoroni Inky Impression
4" in both its Spectra 6 and legacy ACeP versions via `pi_bin` /
`pi_png`, the Xteink X3 and X4 running CrossInk, and a jailbroken
Kindle Paperwhite 2 via KOReader on `trmnl_png`, plus the
community-confirmed PicPak 4.2" BWRY on its author's firmware.
Clients and hardware profiles ship for more SKUs (the remaining XIAO
panels, the TRMNL X, Pi Pico Plus 2W via `pico_bin`, generic
CircuitPython boards) that are awaiting a real-hardware report. See
[what's tested](compatibility.md#whats-been-tested-on-real-hardware).
