# Cloud relay contract

The wire contract for running a panel at a remote location without exposing the
home instance to the internet. A small cloud **relay** is a per-device mailbox
that both ends reach *outbound*: the home instance seals each rendered frame and
`PUT`s it; the remote panel polls and decrypts it. This is the shared boundary
between the Tesserae server, the relay Worker, and the device firmware.

Status: `app/relay_crypto.py` (frame sealing + key derivation) and its
fixed-vector tests exist. The relay Worker (`packages/relay/`), the home-side
transport (`app/relay_publisher.py`, `app/relay_pairing.py`,
`app/relay_client.py`), and the Settings UI are the rest of the feature. This
document is authoritative for all three sides; the golden vectors below are
load-bearing.

## Roles and trust model

- **Home instance** renders locally, holds the per-device frame key, seals each
  frame, and uploads it to the relay. Outbound HTTPS only, never accepts an
  inbound connection.
- **Relay** (Cloudflare Worker + R2; no Durable Object, since scheduled-poll
  delivery has no long-poll to coordinate) stores the latest **sealed** frame
  per device and brokers pairing. It authenticates both
  ends but is **zero-knowledge**: it holds ciphertext, both public keys, and the
  read token, never the frame key.
- **Panel firmware** derives the frame key at pairing, polls its mailbox, and
  decrypts. Holds the relay URL, its device token, and its frame key in NVS.

The frame key is an X25519 + HKDF shared secret that is **never transmitted**.
The relay therefore cannot decrypt a dashboard even though it can validate a
poll.

## Base URL and versioning

All routes are under `/v1`. The hosted relay is `https://relay.tesserae.ink`;
a self-hosted Worker uses its own origin (`packages/relay/`). The relay base URL
is per-install configuration on the home side, so the two are interchangeable.

**Send a descriptive `User-Agent`.** The hosted relay sits behind Cloudflare bot
protection, which blocks known-bot user agents (e.g. `Python-urllib`) with a
`403` before the request reaches the Worker. Any non-default UA passes; the home
client sends `tesserae/relay`.

## Authentication

Bearer tokens in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, compared timing-safe. The
relay stores only `sha256(token)`.

- **Publisher token** — issued to a home install at registration; authorizes
  everything an install does (pairing broker, frame upload, revoke) under its
  own `install_id`.
- **Device token** — minted by the home instance per remote panel, forwarded to
  the panel once through the relay at pairing; authorizes exactly one mailbox
  (`GET .../frame`).

Unknown / revoked token → `401`. Token valid but for the wrong install or device
→ `403`.

Revoking a device (`DELETE /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>`, publisher token)
deletes its mailbox **and its token record**, so a revoked panel's next poll is
a real `401`, not the empty-mailbox `204` a freshly paired panel sees. `401` is
therefore an unambiguous "you are no longer paired" signal: firmware should
drop its stored pairing and reopen setup rather than retry. Completing a
pairing for a device id that already has a token likewise invalidates the
previous token, so re-pairing a panel leaves exactly one working credential.

## Errors

```json
{ "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "…" } }
```

Closed `code` set: `invalid_request`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`,
`pairing_expired`, `conflict`.

## Install registration

```
POST /v1/install/register
Body: { "install_pubkey": "<base64url X25519, 32 bytes>", "label": "<optional>" }
→ 201 { "install_id": "<opaque>", "publisher_token": "<token, shown once>" }
```

An **entitlement hook** runs first (default: allow). A gated relay can require a
Sponsors/paid check here without any contract change; a rejection is `403`.

## Pairing (remote rendezvous)

The panel never reaches the home LAN. Pairing is brokered through the relay:

```
  Home                         Relay                          Panel

```

### Endpoints

```
POST /v1/i/<install>/pair/codes            (publisher)
Body (optional): { "ttl_seconds": <int> }   (clamped to 300..86400; default 600)
→ 201 { "code": "<6+ chars>", "expires_at": "<iso8601>" }

POST /v1/pair                              (unauthenticated)
Body: { "code": "<code>", "panel_pubkey": "<base64url X25519>",
        "panel_w": <int?>, "panel_h": <int?>, "model": "<kind id?>",
        "gamut": "<gamut id?>" }
→ 202 { "status": "pending" }   (unknown/expired code → 404 pairing_expired)

`panel_w` / `panel_h` / `model` / `gamut` are an **optional self-report**: the
panel tells home its geometry, device kind, and colour gamut so the operator
doesn't have to pre-enter them. Home uses them to fill in anything the pairing
slot left blank (slot wins when both are present). `model` is a Tesserae
device-kind id (e.g. `esp32_client`), and home falls back to that default when
neither names a valid kind; `gamut` is a Tesserae gamut id (e.g. `waveshare_e6`,
`mono`). Report the gamut whenever the build's differs from the kind's default:
home resolves (`model`, `gamut`) to the most specific hardware-catalog kind, so
a grayscale or BWR build gets the renderer that packs at its bit depth (an
E1001 grayscale build needs 2-bpp 96000-byte frames, not the mono kind's 1-bpp
48000) without the operator pre-selecting the SKU.

GET  /v1/i/<install>/pair/pending          (publisher)
→ 200 { "pending": [ { "code": "…", "panel_pubkey": "…", "panel_w": <int?>,
                       "panel_h": <int?>, "model": "<id?>", "gamut": "<id?>" } ] }

POST /v1/i/<install>/pair/<code>/complete  (publisher)
Body: { "device_id": "<id>", "device_token": "<token>",
        "device_token_sha256": "<hex>", "home_pubkey": "<base64url X25519>",
        "config": { … } }
→ 200 {}

GET  /v1/pair/<code>                        (unauthenticated, poll)
→ 200 { "status": "ready", "install_id": "…", "home_pubkey": "…",
        "device_token": "…", "device_id": "…", "config": { … } }
   or 200 { "status": "pending" }
```

The plaintext `device_token` transits the relay exactly once (in `complete`,
returned once from `GET /v1/pair/<code>`) so it can reach the panel; the relay
then retains only `device_token_sha256` for future poll validation. The frame
key is **not** part of pairing: both sides derive it from the exchanged public
keys.

Codes are single-use and expire (default 10 minutes). Pairing state is
short-lived; mailbox state is not.

## Frames

```
PUT /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/frame       (publisher)
Headers: ETag: "<render digest>"
         X-Tesserae-Panel-W, X-Tesserae-Panel-H, X-Tesserae-Format,
         X-Tesserae-Renderer, X-Tesserae-Meta (base64url JSON of the render
         payload: rotate/scale/bg/saturation/palette_signature/…)
Body: the sealed frame (application/octet-stream)
→ 200 {}   (same ETag already stored → 200, treated as idempotent)

GET /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/frame        (device token)
Headers: If-None-Match: "<last etag>"
→ 304                        (unchanged)
   204                        (no frame yet)
   200 + sealed body, with ETag + the same X-Tesserae-* metadata headers
```

The frame **body** is opaque to the relay. The metadata headers are
**plaintext** (panel dimensions and render hints are not sensitive); only the
image is sealed. A firmware that wants everything sealed can ignore the headers
and read the dimensions from the decrypted payload instead.

### Sealed-frame format

```
sealed = nonce (12 bytes) || AES-256-GCM(frame_bytes, key, nonce, aad="")
```

The 16-byte GCM tag is appended by the cipher, so `len(sealed) == 12 + len(frame)
+ 16`. The nonce is random per seal.

## Device status (telemetry)

A relay panel never reaches the home instance, so its heartbeat is relayed too.
The panel `POST`s the **same status JSON it would send a home REST server**
(battery, RSSI, firmware, etc. — whatever the device kind's `parse_status`
consumes); the relay stores the latest; the home instance pulls it and feeds it
through its normal status pipeline (live cache, battery history, events).

```
POST /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/status      (device token)
Body: the status JSON (as posted to a home REST /status endpoint)
→ 200 {}

GET  /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/status      (publisher token)
→ 200 { "body": "<verbatim status JSON>", "received_at": "<iso8601>" }
   204   (none posted yet)
```

Status is **plaintext** (operational telemetry, not dashboard content), stored
one-per-device and overwritten on each post; it's dropped when the device is
revoked. `received_at` is the relay's receive time, so it doubles as
`last_seen` for the panel. The panel should post status on its normal wake
cadence (typically alongside the frame poll). This channel is optional: without
it, a relay device simply shows no battery / signal / firmware and an unknown
last-seen.

### Buttons over the relay

A relay panel's frame GET terminates at the relay, so the REST button contract
(`?button=<name>&button_event_id=<uint>` on the frame poll) can't reach the
home instance. Instead, on a button wake the panel includes the same two
fields **in the status JSON body** (exactly as the REST `/status` body-carried
form in `docs/dev/client-protocol.md`):

```json
{ "battery": 87, "button": "a", "button_event_id": 12 }
```

The relay stores and forwards the body verbatim, as always. The home instance
dispatches the press through its normal button pipeline when it pulls the
status, and the resulting render arrives through the frame mailbox; the panel
should keep polling the frame endpoint during its awake window to pick it up.
Latency is bounded by the home poll interval (the home side polls fast for a
burst after a press, so follow-up presses in the same awake window land
quickly).

Because the status slot is latest-only, a button-carrying post could be
overwritten by a later idle beat before the home instance pulls it. Firmware
should therefore repeat `button` + `button_event_id` unchanged on **every**
status post of the same wake; the home side de-duplicates on the event id, so
repeats are safe and an overwrite no longer loses the press. A monotonically
increasing `button_event_id` is required on this path (the REST time-window
fallback is unreliable over a polled relay).

The status POST's response carries the current config etag when a config doc
exists (see below), so a firmware that posts status learns about a config
change without an extra request:

```
→ 200 { "config_etag": "<etag>" }    (or {} before any config was pushed)
```

## Device config

Settings edits on the home instance (sleep interval, button wake window,
button map, always-on) reach a local device through its broker config topic or
its next REST poll. A relay panel gets the same document through a config
mailbox, sealed exactly like frames so the relay stores ciphertext only:

```
PUT /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/config       (publisher)
Headers: ETag: "<config etag>"
Body: sealed config JSON (application/octet-stream)
→ 200 {}   (idempotent on a repeated ETag)

GET /v1/i/<install>/d/<device>/config       (device token)
Headers: If-None-Match: "<last etag>"
→ 304                        (unchanged)
   204                        (no config pushed yet)
   200 + sealed body, with ETag
```

The plaintext (after `unseal` with `frame_key`) is the same JSON object a
local REST device receives in the `config` field of its status response,
e.g. `{"sleep_interval_s": 300, "always_on": false}`. The home instance
uploads it at pairing completion (via the pairing `config` field) and again
whenever the stored per-device config changes; the mailbox holds only the
latest document. It's dropped when the device is revoked.

## Key derivation

X25519 ECDH, then HKDF-SHA256 to the 32-byte AES key:

```
shared = X25519(our_private, their_public)          # 32 bytes
frame_key = HKDF-SHA256(ikm=shared, salt=<none>, info="tesserae-relay-frame-key-v1", L=32)
```

Both sides derive the same key: `derive(home_priv, panel_pub) ==
derive(panel_priv, home_pub)`. Public/private keys are raw 32-byte X25519,
base64url (no padding) on the wire.

## Golden vectors

Firmware and any reimplementation must reproduce these exactly. Generated from
fixed private scalars (`home_priv = 0x01·32`, `panel_priv = 0x02·32`); see
`tests/test_relay_crypto.py`.

```
home_pubkey   = a4e09292b651c278b9772c569f5fa9bb13d906b46ab68c9df9dc2b4409f8a209
panel_pubkey  = ce8d3ad1ccb633ec7b70c17814a5c76ecd029685050d344745ba05870e587d59
frame_key     = 613376ae6bc97931b6d33c17aaf561fb2ff2e2f12937249705e1e5b75dd98e83

nonce         = 00112233445566778899aabb
frame (hex)   = 74657373657261652d6672616d652d0001027061796c6f6164
sealed (hex)  = 00112233445566778899aabb4fa3210211222b8aa47f010d2a30fc71c
                70e6de8d4345adf90c057a2b39262b5ab8cee9507d7839ce8
```

(`sealed` is the two lines concatenated.)

## Firmware responsibilities

1. Accept a relay base URL + pairing code (captive portal / companion app).
2. Generate an X25519 keypair; `POST /v1/pair { code, panel_pubkey }`, and
   include your `panel_w`, `panel_h`, and `model` (a Tesserae kind id such as
   `esp32_client`) so the operator doesn't have to pre-enter them. Poll
   `GET /v1/pair/<code>` until `ready`. The `ready` response carries
   `install_id` + `device_id`, which scope every later route
   (`/v1/i/<install_id>/d/<device_id>/…`).
3. Derive `frame_key` from `home_pubkey`; store `relay_url`, `install_id`,
   `device_id`, `device_token`, `frame_key` in NVS.
4. On the normal wake cadence: `GET .../frame` with `If-None-Match`; on `200`,
   `unseal` the body with `frame_key` and paint; on `304`/`204`, keep the
   current image. No long-poll in v1.
5. On the same wake, `POST .../status` with the device's status JSON (battery,
   RSSI, `fw_version`, etc. — the same body a REST client posts to a home
   `/status` endpoint), so the Devices UI shows battery / signal / firmware /
   last-seen. Optional, but recommended.
6. When the status response's `config_etag` differs from the stored one (or
   on a wake where status wasn't posted), `GET .../config` with
   `If-None-Match`; on `200`, `unseal` with `frame_key`, apply the JSON
   (sleep interval, button wake, button map — same fields as a REST status
   response's `config` block), and store the new etag. Optional: a firmware
   that skips this simply keeps its pairing-time config.
7. On a button wake, include `button` + `button_event_id` in the status body
   (see "Buttons over the relay" above), repeat them on every status post of
   that wake, and keep polling `GET .../frame` through the awake window so the
   resulting render is painted.
8. Treat a `401` from any device-token route as "this pairing was revoked":
   drop the stored pairing (token, frame key, install/device ids) and reopen
   setup. Don't factory-reset anything else, and don't retry the token.

The panel talks only to the relay in steady state; it never needs the home
instance's address.
