# Add hardware support

Tesserae's device model has two tiers:

1. **Protocols** in `devices/<id>/`. Python plugin folders that implement how
   Tesserae talks to firmware: `parse_status`, optional `validate_config`, the
   BYOS HTTP endpoints, the MQTT topic layout, the binary packing. Each
   protocol covers one wire format.
2. **Hardware catalog** in `hardware/<vendor>/<model>.json`. Data-only JSON
   files that declare a specific SKU's panel dimensions, gamut, vendor
   metadata, and any protocol-specific defaults. Each catalog entry
   references an existing protocol by id.

Adding a new e-paper SKU that speaks an existing protocol is a single JSON
file. No Python, no tests at the SKU level (the protocol's tests already
cover the wire format).

## When to use the catalog

Use a catalog entry when:

- Your hardware speaks an existing protocol (TRMNL BYOS, MQTT 4-bpp binary,
  MQTT PNG, REST pull).
- The only things that differ from existing SKUs are panel dimensions,
  gamut, vendor metadata, refresh cadence, or protocol-specific config.
- You want the SKU to ship with Tesserae without forking a Python module.

Write a new protocol folder under `devices/<id>/` when:

- Your hardware speaks a wire format Tesserae doesn't yet implement.
- You need custom `parse_status` / `validate_config` logic.
- You need new MQTT topics or new BYOS endpoint shapes.

If in doubt, lean toward the catalog. Most hardware is a panel plus an
existing protocol.

## The schema

The full schema lives at
[`schema/hardware.schema.json`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/blob/main/schema/hardware.schema.json).
Key fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tesserae_compat` | yes | Host major-version compat string, e.g. `"1.x"`. |
| `id` | yes | Unique kind id, matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. |
| `name` | yes | Human-readable name, shown in device pickers. |
| `vendor` | yes | Vendor name. |
| `protocol` | yes | Id of the protocol folder under `devices/` to inherit from. |
| `panel` | yes | Panel block: `{w, h, orientation?, gamut?, native_w?, native_h?, underscan?}`. |
| `url` | no | Product page URL. |
| `icon` | no | Phosphor icon slug (no `ph-` prefix). |
| `description` | no | One-paragraph description. |
| `protocol_config` | no | Free-form protocol-specific defaults. Each protocol owns its own validation. |
| `config_schema_extends` | no | Additive merge over the protocol's `config_schema`. Use sparingly. |
| `refresh_floor_s` | no | Lower bound on the device's poll cadence. |
| `image_format` | no | Wire format hint: `png` / `bin` / `webp`. |
| `notes_md` | no | Maintainer notes shown on the docs hardware page. |
| `deprecated_aliases` | no | Older ids this SKU also registers under, for back-compat after a rename. |

## A worked example

The bundled
[`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1003.json`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/blob/main/hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1003.json)
is the reference:

```json
{
  "tesserae_compat": "1.x",
  "id": "seeed_reterminal_e1003",
  "name": "Seeed reTerminal E1003",
  "vendor": "Seeed Studio",
  "url": "https://www.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-E1003-p-6731.html",
  "icon": "device-tablet",
  "description": "10.3 inch monochrome ePaper terminal with 16-level greyscale, ESP32-S3, up to six-month battery. Speaks Tesserae's TRMNL BYOS endpoints once flashed with TRMNL firmware.",
  "protocol": "trmnl_client",
  "panel": {
    "w": 1404,
    "h": 1872,
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "name": "10.3 inch monochrome ePaper",
    "gamut": "mono",
    "native_w": 1404,
    "native_h": 1872
  },
  "protocol_config": {
    "model_header": "reTerminal E1003"
  },
  "refresh_floor_s": 60,
  "image_format": "png",
  "notes_md": "The reTerminal E1003 ships with Seeed's own ESP32-S3 UI; flash with TRMNL firmware to use the BYOS path, then point the device's API URL at your Tesserae base URL and pair via the access token shown in Settings -> Devices."
}
```

## How loading works

1. At boot, `device_loader.discover()` walks `devices/` and registers each
   folder-based kind. `trmnl_client` registers here as a protocol.
2. The loader then walks `hardware/` recursively. The E1003 file passes
   schema validation, and the loader looks up `trmnl_client` in the
   registry.
3. The catalog builds a derived `Device`: shares the protocol's
   `parse_status` Python module, carries the SKU's own manifest (the
   panel block, name, vendor, `protocol_config`, etc.).
4. The derived Device registers under `seeed_reterminal_e1003`. The
   Settings UI's kind picker now offers it alongside folder-defined kinds.

The flow is identical to a folder-defined kind because the catalog-derived
Device is indistinguishable from a folder kind at the registry level.

## How a real device pairs

For a TRMNL-BYOS-compatible SKU (like the E1003), once the catalog entry is
registered, pairing follows the standard TRMNL flow:

1. **Settings → Devices → Add device → TRMNL**. Pick the SKU from the kind
   dropdown.
2. Tesserae mints a short access token. Paste it into the device's TRMNL
   firmware config (web flasher / serial console / however the firmware
   takes config).
3. The device polls `GET /api/display`. Tesserae's BYOS endpoint responds
   with the rendered frame URL.

For MQTT-based SKUs, the device subscribes to the topics the protocol
declares (with the SKU's instance id substituted). For REST-pull SKUs, the
device polls `/api/v1/device/<id>/frame`. See
[Install a client](../install/clients.md) for the per-client setup.

## Backwards compatibility

The loader follows three rules so existing installs see no behaviour
change when a new SKU lands:

- **Folder kinds always win on id conflict.** If a hardware JSON declares
  `id: trmnl_client` and a `devices/trmnl_client/` folder exists, the
  folder kind keeps its slot and the JSON entry surfaces as
  `"id already in use"` in the loader-error panel.
- **`deprecated_aliases` register the canonical kind under both names.**
  When you rename a SKU (say you shipped `acme_panel_v1` and want to
  standardise on `acme_panel`), add
  `"deprecated_aliases": ["acme_panel_v1"]` and existing device-instance
  files keyed on the old id keep resolving.
- **Orphan device instances surface as errors, not 500s.** If a user has
  an instance whose `kind_of` no longer resolves to anything, the Settings
  UI flags it as "missing kind" rather than crashing the page.

## Contributing a new SKU

1. **Pick a protocol.** Check `devices/` for an existing protocol that
   matches your hardware's wire format. If none fit, you'll need a new
   protocol folder (see [Architecture](architecture.md)).
2. **Write the JSON file.** Drop it under `hardware/<vendor>/<model>.json`.
   The vendor folder is just an organisation hint, not load-bearing for
   the loader.
3. **Test locally.**

    ```sh
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_hardware_catalog.py -q
    .venv/bin/python -m app.main --dev
    ```

    `pytest` confirms your schema validation passes. The dev server lets
    you confirm the kind appears in **Settings → Devices → Add device**
    under the right vendor.

4. **Verify on real hardware** if you have it. Pair a device against the
   new SKU, push a render, confirm the panel paints.
5. **Open a PR** with the JSON file. The bundled
   `seeed/reterminal_e1003.json` is the shape to mirror. Update
   [`docs/compatibility.md`](../compatibility.md) too if your SKU
   introduces a new resolution / gamut combination the matrix doesn't
   already cover.

## Per-protocol notes

What each protocol currently reads from `protocol_config`:

### `trmnl_client`

- `model_header` (string): the value the firmware sends in the `Model`
  HTTP header. Read by `app/trmnl_api.py` to drive auto-provision and
  panel-dim fallback for native TRMNL devices.

### `pi_bin_client` / `pi_png_client` / `esp32_client` / `esp32_bw_client` / `pico_bin_client`

No `protocol_config` fields are read today. The SKU's `panel` block carries
everything the renderers need.

As protocols add new fields, they'll be documented here. The schema's
`additionalProperties: true` on `protocol_config` means you can stash
extra keys for a protocol you're prototyping without a schema PR.

## Catalog vs. community marketplace

The catalog under `hardware/` ships bundled in the repo. A community
distribution channel (similar to the
[`tesserae-widgets`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widgets) catalog
for widgets) is a future task. For now, hardware support contributions go
via PRs to the main repo.
