# Quickstart: Seeed ePaper Devices (unified firmware)

The recommended path for every Seeed ePaper device Tesserae supports. One firmware image, one web flasher, one Wi-Fi captive-portal flow, one Tesserae registration. About ten minutes from opening the box to the panel painting a dashboard.

Covers the reTerminal E-series (E1001 / E1002 / E1003 / E1004) plus the XIAO ePaper family (XIAO EE02 for the 13.3" Spectra 6 kit, the integrated XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel with an ESP32-C3 on board, and the XIAO ePaper 7.5" S3 driver board sold as the TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY Kit).

!!! tip "Prefer TRMNL BYOS firmware?"
    If you'd rather stay on TRMNL's firmware and use Tesserae as a BYOS server, follow the older [Seeed reTerminal E-Series (TRMNL BYOS)](seeed-reterminal.md) or [Seeed XIAO 7.5" (TRMNL BYOS)](seeed-xiao.md) guide. This page is for the native Tesserae firmware path.

!!! warning "Two different XIAO 7.5-inch products"
    The **XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel** is Seeed's integrated unit with an ESP32-C3 soldered on. The **TRMNL 7.5" (OG) DIY Kit** is a XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus driver board plus the same glass. They paint byte-identical frames, so it's easy to pick the wrong one from the kind list, but the firmware images are **not** interchangeable and each kind names its own OTA lineage. Flash and register against the one matching the board you actually have. If you picked wrong, re-flash and let the device re-announce; Tesserae moves the existing device to the declared kind and keeps its id, token, and history.

Pick your device, then keep reading. Every device follows the same four steps.

## 01 — Flash the Tesserae firmware

Tesserae ships a **web-based firmware flasher**. Chrome / Edge / Chromium-based browsers only; Firefox and Safari don't yet expose the Web Serial API the flasher needs.

!!! warning "macOS users: install the WCH CH340 driver first"
    The reTerminal E1001 / E1002 / E1003 / E1004 flash through an on-board **WCH CH340** USB-serial bridge. macOS doesn't ship a driver for it, so without one the flasher can't see the device on the serial port list.

    - Install the [WCH CH34x DriverKit driver](https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos) (`WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos`).
    - After install, enable it under **System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions → Driver Extensions**. It'll sit in "activated waiting for user" until you toggle it on.
    - The port then appears as `/dev/cu.wchusbserial*` and the flasher can see it.

    Linux and Windows have the driver in-tree; no action needed there. The XIAO boards use a different USB bridge that macOS handles natively.

1. Plug the device into your computer over USB. Use a real data cable, not a charge-only cable, and make sure the port supports data (front-panel USB on a desktop tower sometimes doesn't).
2. Open **[tesserae.ink/flash](https://tesserae.ink/flash)** in Chrome or Edge.
3. Select your device from the list. If your device isn't there, check the "Which device do you have?" table above; the flasher shows only devices that have a matching firmware image built.
4. Click **Connect**, pick the serial port for your device, and click **Install**.
5. Wait 60-90 seconds for the flash to complete. The panel goes blank + resets automatically at the end; leave the USB cable plugged in until the flasher confirms success.

!!! note "USB serial permissions"
    On macOS the browser prompts once; grant it. On Linux you may need to add yourself to the `dialout` group and log out / back in if the flasher can't see the serial port. On Windows the driver installs automatically the first time you plug in the device.

## 02 — Connect to Wi-Fi

After flashing, the device boots into a **soft-AP setup mode** and broadcasts an open Wi-Fi network named `tesserae-<macsuffix>` (e.g. `tesserae-a4b2c9`).

1. On your phone or laptop, join that Wi-Fi network. Your OS may complain that there's no internet on this network; ignore it and stay connected.
2. A captive portal loads automatically. If it doesn't, browse to `http://192.168.4.1/`.
3. Fill in:
   - **Wi-Fi SSID**: your home network.
   - **Wi-Fi password**: your home network's password.
   - **Tesserae server URL**: `http://<your-server>:8765` (whatever URL you'd type in a browser to reach the web UI).
4. Save. The device restarts onto your home Wi-Fi.

If your Tesserae server publishes `tesserae.local` via mDNS, you can enter `http://tesserae.local:8765`. Otherwise use its LAN IP.

## 03 — Register the device in Tesserae

The device now polls Tesserae's REST discover endpoint every 30 seconds. Within a minute of restart you'll see it in **Settings → Devices → Discovered** with the correct kind (E1001, E1002, EE02, etc.) auto-detected from what the firmware reports.

1. Open Tesserae's web UI: **Settings → Devices → Discovered**.
2. Click **Register** on the new device. Optionally rename it to something you'll recognise ("kitchen", "hallway", "bedside").
3. The device picks up its access token on the next `/discover` poll (within 30 seconds) and moves from **Discovered** to the regular **Devices** list.

No token to type by hand. No SSH. The device is now authenticated and ready to receive frames.

## 04 — Compose a dashboard and push

In the editor:

1. **Dashboards → New**.
2. Build a layout that suits the panel. The mono devices (E1001 / both XIAO 7.5" variants) want high-contrast bold typography; the greyscale E1003 handles muted photos and dithered gradients well; the Spectra 6 devices (E1002 / E1004 / EE02) suit weather widgets with dedicated colour blocks per element.
3. Bind the page to your device in the device picker on the right side of the composer.
4. Hit **Push**. The device wakes on its next poll, downloads the pre-rendered frame from Tesserae, paints, and sleeps.

Refresh cadence is set per-dashboard on the **Schedules** card. **Smart sync** is the natural fit for battery devices; it renders just before each device wake so the panel always paints a fresh frame without burning battery on idle renders.

## Per-device notes

Some panels have quirks worth knowing about.

- **E1002 (Spectra 6, 800×480):** Tesserae quantises to the panel's 6-colour palette server-side (black, white, yellow, red, blue, green). The panel's full refresh takes about 30 seconds; the Spectra process is what's slow, not Tesserae or the firmware. That's normal panel physics, not a bug.
- **E1003 (mono greyscale, 10.3"):** the panel supports 16 levels of grey via its IT8951 driver. Tesserae's greyscale renderer ships photos as real gradients rather than 1-bit dither. Portrait aspect (1872 tall) suits list-shaped dashboards.
- **E1004 (Spectra 6, 13.3"):** same colour behaviour as E1002 but at a much larger canvas. Refresh cycle is roughly 40 seconds. Seeed advertises up to 6 months of battery life at one refresh per day.
- **XIAO EE02:** frame format is byte-identical to the E1004 (both are 13.3" Spectra 6 at 1200×1600). The XIAO driver board is smaller and cheaper; useful when you want the panel without the reTerminal case.
- **XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel (C3):** Seeed's integrated unit, ESP32-C3 soldered on. Frame format is byte-identical to the E1001. Two things differ from the rest of the family: it reports no battery at all (see below), and it has no user buttons, only Boot and Reset, so there are no page-turn bindings to set up. Supported from device-firmware v1.16.0.
- **Seeed XIAO ePaper 7.5" (S3):** a XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus driver board plus the same 7.5" glass, sold as the TRMNL 7.5" (OG) DIY Kit. Frame format is byte-identical to the E1001 and to the C3 panel above. If you already followed the [TRMNL OG quickstart](trmnl.md), it also applies here; this unified flow is the alternative if you'd rather run the native Tesserae firmware.
- **Battery reporting:** the reTerminal E1001 / E1002 / E1003 / E1004 and the XIAO EE02 report battery correctly. The **XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel (C3)** cannot: the hardware has no divider to an ADC pin, so there's nothing to measure the cell with. It reports no battery reading, and Tesserae treats that as unknown rather than empty, so the panel carries no battery indicator, no history chart, and no low-battery overlay. That's expected, not a fault.

## What if it didn't work?

| Symptom | Likely cause + fix |
|---|---|
| Device doesn't appear in Discovered after 2 minutes. | Check the Wi-Fi credentials were accepted (device should be off the soft-AP now). Verify the Tesserae server URL is reachable from the device's network: `curl http://<server>:8765/api/healthz` from another machine on the same LAN. |
| Discovered card says the wrong kind (e.g. `esp32_client` instead of `seeed_reterminal_e1002`). | The firmware kind string doesn't match the hardware catalog. Update to the latest firmware from tesserae.ink/flash. |
| Panel refreshes but shows garbage / stripes. | Frame size mismatch. Check that Tesserae's server version is at least v0.64.60 (the E-series manifests need to be present). Settings → Devices → your card → Debug shows the running version. |
| Web flasher won't connect. | Firefox / Safari don't support Web Serial. Use Chrome or Edge. Also make sure you're using a data-capable USB cable and port. |
| Serial-port list is empty on macOS with a reTerminal plugged in. | The WCH CH340 driver isn't installed / enabled. Install [`WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos`](https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch34xser_macos), then toggle it on under **System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions → Driver Extensions**. |
| Firmware flashes but device stays in soft-AP mode forever. | Wi-Fi credentials weren't saved. Re-join the soft-AP and re-enter them; some captive portals need an explicit "Save" tap. |
| Frame downloads but panel doesn't paint. | Battery voltage may be too low for the panel refresh voltage doubler. Plug the USB cable back in and let it charge for an hour; try again. |

## Next steps

- [Set up multiple panels on one server](../install/devices.md#multiple-panels): different dashboards on different Seeed devices, all painted by the same Tesserae install.
- [Add a rotation](../install/devices.md#next-steps): cycle through several dashboards on the same panel across the day.
- [Bind the front buttons](../install/buttons.md): rotate through dashboards, jump straight to one, or force a refresh with the reTerminal's three front buttons. Default is `left → previous`, `right → next`, `refresh → re-render`; override per device from **Settings → Devices → General → Buttons**.
- [Browse community widgets](https://tesserae.ink/catalog/): one-click installs for Spotify, GitHub, OctoPrint, F1, and more.
- [Firmware source](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-firmware): read the code, file issues, contribute board support for new panels.
