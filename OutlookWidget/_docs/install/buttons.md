# Physical buttons

Hardware buttons on a Tesserae device (the front buttons on a Seeed
reTerminal E-Series, the back-panel buttons on a Pimoroni Inky
Impression, etc.) can be bound to server-side **actions**: rotate
through the dashboards on this device, jump straight to a specific
dashboard, download the latest rendered frame, force a fresh render,
or fire a webhook. The mapping is
per-device and edited from **Settings → Devices**.

Introduced in v0.65.0. Server-side works for any device kind whose
firmware speaks the button contract; ESP32 firmwares (Seeed reTerminal
E-Series, Waveshare, XIAO ePaper family) got wire support in the same
release. Pi + Inky Impression back-button support is on the roadmap.

## What buttons can do

The default map, applied to any device that doesn't override it, is:

| Button | Action | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `left` | `rotate_prev` | Move back one step in the device's rotation |
| `right` | `rotate_next` | Advance one step in the device's rotation |
| `refresh` | `refresh` | Re-render + re-push the current step |

That's the "conventional three-button e-ink appliance" shape. If your
hardware has different names (`a` / `b` / `c` / `d` on a Pimoroni Inky,
say) or more than three, you configure them under the device.

## Configuring buttons per device

**Settings → Devices** → open the card for your device → **General**
tab. Near the bottom of the tab you'll find a **Buttons** section
with a small JSON editor and a live "effective map" fold-out showing
what each button *actually resolves to right now* after the default,
global, and per-device layers are merged.

To override, drop a JSON object into the textarea:

```json
{
  "a": "page:morning_briefing",
  "b": "page:weather_forecast",
  "c": "page:home_status",
  "d": "page:family_calendar"
}
```

An empty textarea clears the override and the device falls back to
the app-global map (**Settings → Server → Buttons**, if configured)
and finally to the built-in default above. Save is wired into the
device card's normal **Save changes** button; validation rejects
malformed JSON, unknown actions, and bad action arguments before
writing.

## Actions

The value on each button is an **action spec**: either a bare action
name (`rotate_next`) or `<action>:<arg>` (`page:morning_briefing`,
`webhook:https://…`).

| Action | Argument | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `rotate_prev` | none | Advance the device's rotation one step backwards. Wraps at the start. |
| `rotate_next` | none | Advance the device's rotation one step forwards. Wraps at the end. |
| `fetch_latest` | none | Download and repaint the latest frame already rendered for this device. Does not re-render, push, move the rotation, or set a manual override. |
| `refresh` | none | Force a fresh render + push of the current step. Useful when a widget's upstream data changed but the composition hash is stable. |
| `step:<index>` | rotation step index (0-based) | Jump straight to that step in the rotation. |
| `page:<page_id>` | dashboard page id | Push a specific dashboard to this device. Doesn't touch rotation state, so a later timer wake resumes the scheduled step. |
| `webhook:<url>` | absolute `http(s)://` URL | Fire a POST to that URL with `{device_id, button, button_event_id, action_spec, timestamp, rotation_id, step_index, step_page_id}` in the body. Fire-and-forget, 3s timeout. |

Adding a new action is a plugin hook (`app.button_actions.register`);
third-party actions show up in the admin UI's help text automatically.

## Manual override sticks until the next anchor

When a button press moves the device's rotation position (a rotate,
a refresh, a `step:`), the new position is treated as a **manual
override** that suppresses the time-based scheduler for the rest of
the day. This is what you almost always want: pressing "next" on a
kitchen panel shouldn't get yanked back by the scheduler a minute
later.

The override expires at the rotation's next daily anchor (midnight
local by default). If you'd rather set a different hold window,
`settings.app.button_hold_seconds` overrides the anchor-based expiry
with a fixed number of seconds. `page:<page_id>` shortcuts don't set
an override; they're one-shot pushes that let the scheduler resume
normally on the next timer wake.

## Duplicate presses are dropped

Firmware retries on network flakiness are common. Every event carries
a monotonically increasing `button_event_id`; the server treats an id
equal to the last processed one as a retry and no-ops (a lower id
reads as a counter restart after a power cycle and still dispatches).
Firmwares without a counter fall back to the
same-button-within-3-seconds window (overridable via
`settings.app.button_debounce_s`).

## Buttons on remote (relay) panels

Buttons work on relay-paired panels too. The press rides the panel's
relayed status report instead of the frame request, so the round trip
is store-and-forward: the home instance picks the press up on its
next relay poll (within ~30 seconds, then faster for follow-up
presses while the panel stays awake), renders, and uploads the new
frame for the panel to fetch before it goes back to sleep. Expect
seconds of latency rather than the instant response of a local
panel; presses older than a few minutes (for example if the home
instance was offline) are dropped rather than replayed. Firmware
requirements are in the
[Cloud relay contract](../relay/contract.md).

## Seeing button events on the History page

Every button press writes a row to `/history` with source `button`,
the friendly device name in the target column, and a synthesised
detail line describing what happened:

```
[Button] Kitchen wall panel · button right → rotate_next pushed Afternoon calendar
```

The row also carries the status: `dispatched` (a page was pushed),
`deduped` (retry), `unmapped` (no map entry for that button),
`webhook_dispatched` (webhook queued), `noop` (action resolved to
nothing to do), `error` (bad action arg). Filter by the **Button**
chip in the History toolbar to see just the button feed.

## For firmware / client developers

If you're building a client and want it to send button events, see
the [Client protocol spec](../dev/client-protocol.md). Short version:

- On the frame request: `GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame?button=<name>&button_event_id=<uint>`.
- In the status body: `{"button": "<name>", "button_event_id": <uint>, …}`.
- The server dispatches the mapped action synchronously before
  selecting the frame, so the returned artefact reflects the new
  state on this same wake.
- On a `refresh` action, drop your cached `ETag` before making the
  request so the server always returns `200` with a full frame
  rather than `304`.
