# Privacy

**Tesserae contacts one first-party endpoint, `api.tesserae.ink`, and
nothing else.** There is no account system and no third-party analytics
in the app. The single endpoint is used for: checking for app and
device-firmware updates, reporting an anonymous, aggregate count of how
many installs use each marketplace widget, and a once-a-day heartbeat of
low-cardinality facts about the install.

It is **off by default**. A fresh install never contacts
`api.tesserae.ink` until you opt in, either at the first-run setup wizard
(which asks once, with the full detail) or by turning on **Settings →
System → Online features**. Leave it off and Tesserae never contacts the
endpoint; the update indicators and install counts simply don't appear.
Nothing else in the app phones home. Tesserae also never contacts the
endpoint from a build or dev environment it can positively identify
(GitHub Actions, Codespaces, or Gitpod), since those are not real installs.

What a request may include: your install's random ID, the widget id, and
your running version. A coarse country is derived from your IP address
for aggregate geography and the IP is then discarded. No account, no
personal data, and no IP addresses or User-Agent strings are stored.

Individual widgets you install may make their own external network calls,
documented in their own READMEs. Those are separate from the app.

## What the app never sends

Beyond the aggregate `api.tesserae.ink` requests described above, the app
does not send:

- IP addresses
- hostnames
- file paths
- settings values
- secrets (passwords, tokens, API keys)
- push contents
- dashboard layouts
- broker addresses
- anything tied to a real-world identity

This applies to the app itself. Individual widgets may make external
network calls documented in their own READMEs.

## Install identifier

On first startup Tesserae generates a **random UUID** and stores it
at `data/core/install_id.json`. The value has no connection to your
identity, hardware, IP address, or Tesserae account: it's a random
string, generated with `uuid.uuid4()`, persisted so widgets that
declare `needs_install_id` (shared-world features like the planned
tamagotchi pet or dashboard traveler) can key against a stable
per-install identity across restarts.

Widgets can also request a **widget-scoped derivation** via
`needs_scoped_id`, which returns `SHA-256(install_id + plugin_id)`.
Different widgets get different derived identifiers so their outbound
calls can't be correlated by an external service; the `tesserae_status`
update chip uses this scoped form.

The marketplace install count uses the **raw** install ID instead (the
app-level identity), so a unique install counts once per widget. It
carries no name or personal data; regenerating the identifier below
makes you a fresh install from the count's point of view.

You can regenerate the identifier at any time in
**Settings → System → Install identifier**. Regeneration resets any
per-install state the widget side has accumulated (a pet's history, a
traveler's home waypoint), because from those services' point of view
you look like a new install.

## What the app sends to api.tesserae.ink

Everything below rides the single **Online features** switch (on by
default). Turning it off stops all of it.

### Marketplace install count

When you install a widget from the marketplace, Tesserae POSTs to
`https://api.tesserae.ink/widgets/install` with the widget id, your
install's random ID, and your running version, so the widget's card can
show an anonymous "how many installs use this" count. Reinstalling the
same widget does not inflate the count (it dedupes on your install ID).
The Browse page reads the aggregate counts from
`https://api.tesserae.ink/widgets/installs`. A coarse country is derived
from the request IP on the server side and the IP is then discarded.

### Template marketplace (share + browse)

Sharing a dashboard template is always an explicit action: nothing is sent
until you press Submit in the Share dialog. A submission POSTs to
`https://api.tesserae.ink/templates/submit` with the sanitized template JSON
(the export step strips request headers, options marked secret, and
install-specific values like Home Assistant entity ids; a credential lint
blocks the submission if anything key-shaped remains), a rendered preview
image of the dashboard, your install's random ID, and your running version.
That preview is a **live render**, so it shows whatever your widgets were
displaying when you shared: the Share dialog shows you the exact image and
warns you before you submit, so you can duplicate the dashboard and swap in
placeholder values first if it contains anything you'd rather not publish.
Submissions are human-reviewed before they appear publicly. Your public
author name is a stable pseudonym derived server-side from your install ID
(e.g. `amber-heron-42`); no real name, email, or account is involved.
Reporting a template for takedown sends its public slug, your short reason,
your install's random ID, and your version; the request goes to the same human
review queue, and a report from the install that published the template is
flagged there so an author can pull their own work back.
Browsing templates fetches the public catalog from
`https://api.tesserae.ink/templates/index.json`; installing one fetches its
JSON and POSTs an anonymous install count event (same shape as the widget
install count above). A coarse country is derived from the request IP on the
server side and the IP is then discarded.

### Daily heartbeat

Once a day, Tesserae POSTs to `https://api.tesserae.ink/heartbeat` so the
maintainer can see how many installs are active and what to prioritise.
The body is only low-cardinality, aggregate values: your install's random
ID, the running version and channel, the OS family (linux/macos/windows),
CPU arch, Python minor version, deployment kind (docker/ha_addon/pip/lxc/
source), transport (mqtt/rest/both/none), a **bucketed** device count
(`0`, `1`, `2-3`, `4-9`, `10+`, never the exact number), the set of
device kinds you've configured, the firmware versions running on them
grouped by kind (so the maintainer can see what firmware is in the field),
a Home Assistant boolean, and a **bucketed** count of paired companion apps
(same `0`/`1`/`2-3`/… buckets, never a client name, install id, or app
version). The device count and kinds cover only the
devices you've actually added, not the built-in catalogue. No names, paths,
layouts, or exact counts. The server stores only the **day** (not a
timestamp), so the cadence can't become a per-install activity trace, and
it dedupes to one heartbeat per install per day. A coarse country is
derived from the request IP and the IP is then discarded.

### App update check (header badge + `tesserae_status`)

Tesserae checks for a newer release by fetching
`https://api.tesserae.ink/version/latest?channel=stable&current=<v>&install=<scoped-id>`.
Two things use it: the web UI's header shows an "update available" badge
when a newer release exists (checked once in the background, cached for
several hours, never blocking a page), and the `tesserae_status` widget
shows the same as an on-panel chip when its update indicator is enabled.
The `install` parameter is a scoped, one-way derivation of your install
identifier (not the raw id), so it can't be correlated with the daily
heartbeat. No IP address or User-Agent is stored; only a coarse country
lookup plus the query params. Both are off when Online features is off,
and the widget chip is additionally off per placement by default.

### Device firmware check

Tesserae looks up the latest known firmware version for each of your
registered device kinds against
`https://api.tesserae.ink/firmware/<kind>/latest`, so the Devices card
shows "v1.1.0 (v1.2.0 available)" when a device is behind. The lookup
happens lazily (first Devices page render, then on demand every 60 min).
The only outbound data is the device kind name; no install identifier,
no device-specific fields. With Online features off, the Devices card
still shows the firmware version each device reports in its heartbeat;
the "update available" pill just never fires.

See the [tesserae-api source](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-api)
for the exact server-side implementation.

### Home Assistant App auto-update

When installed as the Home Assistant App, Supervisor manages Tesserae's
update cycle through Home Assistant's own update infrastructure. That
path is a Home Assistant feature, not Tesserae phoning home; the
[Home Assistant privacy policy](https://www.home-assistant.io/privacy/)
covers what Supervisor sends.

## Cloud relay (remote panels)

Separate from the switches above, and off unless you set it up: the
[remote-panel feature](install/remote-panel.md) lets a panel at another
location show your dashboards by way of a cloud relay (the hosted
`relay.tesserae.ink` or [your own](relay/self-host.md)). When enabled,
your server uploads each rendered frame to the relay for the paired remote
panel to fetch. The frame is **sealed end-to-end** with a key only your
server and that panel share, so the relay stores ciphertext only and cannot
read your dashboards; it sees the encrypted frame plus routing metadata
(which install and device, frame size, timing). Nothing is sent for a
device until you pair it, and self-hosting the relay keeps even that
metadata under your control.

## Per-device telemetry (stays on the server)

Tesserae *does* track per-device diagnostics for the displays you
register (battery percentage, RSSI, heartbeat cadence, smart-sync
predictions). That data stays on your server in
`data/core/device_telemetry.json` and `data/core/battery_history.db`,
and is only surfaced inside the admin UI (Settings → Devices, the
battery indicator, smart-sync scheduling). It is never transmitted
off the box.

## Local stats (stays on the server)

The **Stats** page counts what your install does: pushes per day and what
asked for them, frames painted per display, how often each panel checks
in, how long a render takes, and how many of each other event the server
logged. It exists because the event log is capped and rolls over, so
anything spanning months has to be aggregated as it happens.

Those counters live in `data/core/stats.db` on your server. Nothing reads
them except the Stats page and your own export button, and there is no
client or upload path that could send them anywhere. Every row is a date,
a metric name, a dimension, and an integer: no URLs, no dashboard titles,
no push contents, and no clock times finer than the day. Dimensions are
ids you already have (a device id, an event type), and names are resolved
for display rather than written to the file.

The page carries the controls to match: export the whole store as JSON,
pause collection, or delete every counter.

## Docs site analytics

Aggregate analytics on the documentation site
(`dmellok.github.io/tesserae/`) are kept separately from the app and
provide a coarse traffic overview only. The docs site honours
Do-Not-Track headers and skips analytics entirely when DNT is set.
